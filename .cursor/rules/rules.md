- always prefer simple solutions
- avoid code duplication whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and funcitonality, sometimes this means generalization for reusability
- you are careful, make only changes that are requested or you are confident are wll understood and related to the change being requested
- When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. And if you finally do this, make sure to remove the old implementation afterwards so we donâ€™t have duplicate logic. Notify me about such cases
- Keep the codebase very clean and organized
- Avoid writing scripts in files if possible, especially if the script is likely only to be run once
- Avoid having files over 200 lines of code. Refactor at that point
- Mocking data is only needed for tests, never mock data for dev or prod
- Never add stubbing or fake data patterns to code that affects the dev, staging or prod environments
- Never overwrite .env file without first asking and confirming
- Modularize components; small, reusable, single responsibility.
- Maintain a clear file and folder structure
- Group imports logically (third-party, then local).
- Always ensure responsive design
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Separate API logic clearly from frontend if needed.
- Encapsulate API logic into reusable, type-safe modules
- Gracefully handle edge cases (unavailable products, shipping errors).
- Explicitly handle errors gracefully with meaningful messaging.
- Use strategic logging (differentiate between dev and production environments).
- Write concise, meaningful comments only when necessary.
- Never hard-code sensitive secrets or tokens; securely manage via .env variables.
- Always validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection).
- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality and edge cases
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
- Write documentation for every major feature in the `/docs` folder
- Log decisions and major changes in the `/docs/change_log.md` file grouped by date (year-month-day)
- Stick to best practices of each platform, or lib used
- never commit or push without approval
- never commit and push sensitive information
- Clearly specify tech stack, constraints, and project patterns explicitly in each prompt.
- Ensure modularity and incremental development; break complex requests into smaller prompts.
- Optimize project structure for maintainability and readability.
- Clearly differentiate logs for dev and production environments.
