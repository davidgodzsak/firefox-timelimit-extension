- new popup ui/ux is bad, does not follow the design of the existing app
- new popup should show how much time was spent already, how much opens are already spent
- new popup does not allow adding a limit easily 
- new popup has a sun icon instead of cogwheel for settings
- settings page does not allow setting the number of times a page can be opened.
- settings page does not include the app icon
- the checkmark button disappears on the settings screen when I write to the input field
- I think switching tabs and switching back does not count as an open
