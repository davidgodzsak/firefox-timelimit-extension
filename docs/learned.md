- it's nice to have a ".prompts" folder to version the prompts (hidden from Coding Agents)
- it's nice to have a "docs" or "project_management" folder that contain plans, specs, ideas from that were yielded by plannign prompts
- useful reusable prompts: 
    - idea polishing
    - specs
    - planning
    - coding
    - debugging
    - verifying (code quality, test quality, test coverage)
    - testing
    - fixing tests/code
    - fixing code after QA
- probably process things could be automated: running code prompt in phases each phase in a new context, running tests and fixing them after each phase, planning QA and collecting results for next phase to fix, orchestrating all of this
- good to write scripts for packaging the apps
- we should manage docs for ideas, plans, specs, QA results in a better way as now (either living files, or better naming conventions that belong to app versions)
- sometimes specs, plans are changed and then we need to update the docs otherwise we have inconsistencies when the coding agents read those vs the code
- it would be nice to have a tool that can feed some input to the tools as params/arguments but invoke them without the need of copy paste (automated coding process, workflow)
