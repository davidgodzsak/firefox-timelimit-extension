# Disabling limits
We should let people disable a limit only if they provide an excuse. Whenever they try to disable a limit for a website, a random excuse should be shown that they used previously for disabling that site, and we should also display how much time they spent on the site while it was disabled.

This would allow users to see the page in special cases when they need to (e.g. they have a daily limit of 10 minutes on youtube, but sometimes they want to watch an educational video that is an hour long), but reminding them of excuses they made previously.
