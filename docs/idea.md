We need to create a Firefox extension to limit distracting websites. The extension should allow the user to define distracting sites and how much time they are allowed to spend on the site each day. The app should monitor the usage (number of opens, time spent) and when the time is out it should block access to the site and show a simple timeout page instead.


The user should be able to set up simple text notes in the settings that will be shown in the timeout page. These notes are ideas on what the user could do instead of browsing the page:

- play the guitar
- go for a walk
- work on project XYZ
- take a breathing exercise
- etc.


So the UI should consists of two pages:

- setting up distracting sites and their limits
- setting up the timeout screen using motivational alternative tasks to do


The UI of the extension should be well designed trendy. It should be maintaniable and structured in a way that we can swap components or add new ones (e.g. instead of limiting the time in the future we might want to limit number of opens. Or instead of setting a timeout screen with notes we might want a different timout screen)
